This SAD includes the resources to enable this capability by default                  | Green |\n| 7 | Build with Privacy-as-Default with a risk-based approach to security | The pattern architecture will mandate a standards-based approach to resource authentication (Managed Identity), user authorisation (role-based access control) and both user and system activity auditing | Green |\n\n## Architecture Constraints\n\n* External generation of marketing material should follow standard security and access rules concerning all clients, and especially clients with restricted access, such as high net worth and clients with NDA's\n* Marketing material should not persist on external sites longer than is necessary to complete the task.\n  * This is to avoid possible security leaks\n  * Minimise storage costs\n* Access to the service will follow current approved security and access rules.\n  * Managed Identity to provide resource access.\n  * User Identity optional, as calling systems will have already authenticated the user.\n    * If User Identity is passed then it should be validated.\n  * User Identity to satisfy audit.\n\n## Technical Constraints\n\n|
