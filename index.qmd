# Introduction and Goals

## Overview

Today Marcomms manage marketing and brand across the comapny, its subsidiaries and affiliates. The IT systems employed within Marcoms have organically grown over many years, with technologies chosen to meet specific needs at the time rather than aligned to a technology strategy or assessed on a strategic fitness level of the companies IT. Often technology choices were made with a UK-first approach, and therefore some of these solutions impair Marcoms when attempting to offer global services within different territories. Some of these solutions have also poor user experiences, which cause friction for those employed to use these technologies on a day-to-day basis.

As a result, the companies marketing eco-system is disparate and poorly integrated, with poor usability and lacking the ability to centralise and manage brand and content globally.

The Marcoms vision is to start to unify services together, starting with a common production platform where digital assets and brands can be centrally managed and pushed out globally. Marcoms has selected a third-party platform (Frontify) to deliver this capability.

## Goals

The goal of this phase of the implementation is integrate Frontify with the sales platform so that, we can replace Drag and Drop with this new unified service. It is proposed to offer 2 separate solutions to the sales platform users.

* A automated quick brochure generator that has a prescribed approach on how to present documents and images to the service.
  * Ideal generate a email quality brochure, so we can get to market quickly.
* A bespoke option which will allow the users to modify and manipulate the brochures within Frontify.
  * This will generate a print quality brochure, aimed at more selective clients, but will take longer and involve manual manipulation of the brochures content.

There is also the option of performing both brochure operations if need be.
